Welcome to FLARE VM - Malware Analysis Edition! The distribution contains a
number of tools and configurations to enhance malware analysis and reverse
engineering tasks.

Please change the virtual machine network mode to Host Only to prevent malware
from escaping the environment. Finally, take a snapshot so that you could always
revert to a clean image.

You can customize the image by downloading additional packages. For example, to 
install Firefox simply type the following:

  cinst firefox

To keep the distribution up to date, restore networking to NAT or Bridge and type 
in the following command in the Administrator console:

  cup all

Happy Reversing!
